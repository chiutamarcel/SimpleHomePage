# Simple HomePage project

This is a simple homepage I made.
The homepage is not functional and not finished.
To open the project you need Visual Studio.

This was intended to be a big web app and that's why the need for an asp.net project.
Unfortunately, I wasn't satisfied with the idea so I abandoned the project.

Maybe in the future I will translate the homepage to just simple html and css since there is no need for asp.net.
